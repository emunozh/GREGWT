Description:
    Implements the GREGWT (Generalised Regression and Weighting of sample
    survey results) algorithm in the R.  The algorithm implemented in this
    package is based on:

    Bell, P. (2000). Weighting and standard error estimation for ABS household
    surveys (paper prepared for ABS methodology advisory committee); and
